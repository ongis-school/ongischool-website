					<figure class="left marg_right1"><img src="images/ijen.jpg" alt=""></figure>
					<p>
                    The Gili Island Tour is an extremely popular way to see the Gili Islands in a short period of time and really make the most of each of the three islands and have time to slow right down and enjoy the true pace of these lazy and beautiful tropical specks located just of the northwest coast of Lombok. Gili Air is the first port of call which one of the smaller and far less developed of the three islands. You will firstly stop off at Lendang Bajur which is a great traditional market where you will be able to see the traditional culture in its most vibrant atmosphere before seeing the lush mountains of the north coast of Lombok. After this you will leave from Pemenang which is a small fishing village and then travel via a small outrigger to Gili Air. When you land you will be able to immediately indulge in snorkeling, beach combing and enjoying this blissful atmosphere free from tourists, cars dogs and development. All of the Gili Islands have no cars or motorized vehicles of any kind and unlike many places in Indonesia there are also no dogs and in many places fresh water and electricity are luxuries. For a long time the Gili Islands have been popular with divers and those looking to really get away from it all.</p>

<p>On Gili Island Tour you can enjoy snorkeling in rich waters full of tropical fish and turtles and plenty of coral not to mention the diving where there are larger things to see in unbelievable visibility. This unworldly experience is complimented beautifully with a seriously chilled out beach life and some beautiful little restaurants not to mention the small clubs and other villas should you find it too difficult to leave at the end of your Gili Island Tours. Gili Island Tour is a really good way to take time out from Materam, Senggigi or even the south of Lombok and it is also a great way to get around the rest of the islands with a guide and convenience even if you are staying on one of the Gili Islands. Enjoy these areas and still have plenty of time to see everything else enjoy the rest of your holiday. The price is very reasonable which you consider that you will be taking multiple forms of transport from land air-conditioned mini buses to boats and also being guided around all of the areas and being informed of all of the facts and historical factors which Lombok and the Gilis are full of.</p>

<p>To well and truly escape it all and enjoy some of the most laid back atmospheres as well as learning as seeing all there is on all three of the Gili Islands, you will also be able to relax under the shade of a palm, swim and snorkel and enjoy some excellent food on the island of Gili Trawangen. Lunch is included in the price of the tour and on the Gili Island Tour you will be looked after all the way round. </p>

<p><h4>Lombok Tours</h4></p>   
					 
					<figure class="left marg_right1"><img src="images/ijen.jpg" alt=""></figure>
					<p>
                    Lombok tours are run frequently from Bali and there are a variety of different way to embark on this kind of tour for various different budgets and timescales. There are general sight seeing tours and more specifically orientated tours for those who have more specific interests. As Lombok is home to some of the world's best surfing and diving there are a significant proportion of people who travel to Lombok on a tour that is dedicated to these activities. These kinds of Lombok tours are best booked through known and international acclaimed businesses so you can sure of a competent and professional service for you money. As boats are usually required and due to the adventure nature of these Lombok tours, it is usually better to pay a little more if possible because as with most things you really do get what you pay for.</p>

<p>However the most common Lombok tours are sightseeing tours that include the secluded secret beaches of the south that are possibly some of the most beautiful areas in the world, the mount Rinjani and its surrounding villages, the Gili islands where the diving and partying is good as well a there being a very slow and relaxed paced of life and also a night's stay in Senggigi where there is some marvelous dining and accommodation. In the centre of Lombok and really in all areas there are some incredible markets where you can pick up some unusual and interesting items. Lombok is famous for its batik and Ikat fabrics as here the designs used are particularly enchanting and desirable.</p>

<p>Lombok Island is an excellent choice for Bali and beyond tour as it is the closest and smallest island area with the biggest differences to Bali in every way possible. Lombok differs not only culturally but also in its dryer climate and sparser landscapes. Tourism has not yet affected Lombok in the same way that it has in Bali and the only real areas with any kind of a tourism industry are Senggigi on the north east coast, the nearby Gili Islands and the Kuta area of the south of Lombok where the surfers stay although even here services are limited. With the Muslim Sasak culture, the people are different but equally as friendly if you are respectful to their culture. It more important here to where modest clothing when traveling, although it is fine to wear beachwear on the beaches and in the resort areas and towns.</p>


<p>Some of the more specific Lombok tours and longer tours will include extended periods of time island hopping around the Gili Islands and maybe some trekking in the Mount Rinjani area where you can watch the sun rise and set over Bali with incredible views of the entire island. For an easy trip which is inexpensive Lombok is the popular route to take, you can use the bus and ferry option which is incredibly cheap or fly or take a fast boat which is excellent value for the services provided.</p>
